                    "In the early 1990s, English First Division clubs believed that a radical restructuring of football was
                needed if they and the game in general were to develop and flourish. So on 17 July 1991, they signed the
                Founder Members Agreement, establishing the basic principles for the setting up of the Premier League. The
                League would have commercial independence from the Football League and The FA, leaving it free to organise 
                its own broadcast and sponsorship agreement. <br><br>

                    On 20 February 1992, the 22 First Division clubs resigned from the Football League en masse and three months 
                later, on 27 May,  the Premier League was established as a limited company.The first television deal was struck
                with pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB, a radical move at the time, but Sky has been ever-present and has played a key role
                in developing the League to its present levels. The first Premier League campaign started on Saturday 15 August, 1992,
                with 22 clubs.The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea,
                Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, 
                Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield 
                Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon. Of these, six clubs have been ever-present in the Premier
                League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. When the Premier League was 
                formed, there was always the intention to reduce the number of clubs to 20 to promote development and excellence at 
                club and international level. This was achieved at the end of the 1994/95 season when four clubs were relegated and 
                just two promoted."<br><br>

                    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
                requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, 
                diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br><br>

                    This paragraph wlli cover steps that can be taken to prevent yourself from contracting the coronavirus.
                Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or 
                after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                Maintain 6 feet of distance between yourself and people hen you are in public.Everyone should wear a mask in public
                settings and when around people who donâ€™t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are
                difficult to maintain. Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your
                elbow and do not spit.Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not
